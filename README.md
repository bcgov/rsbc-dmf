System Architecture
--------------
![alt text](openshift/Medical-Portal-Architecture.png)

Repository Map
--------------

- **functional-tests**: Source for BDD tests
- **openshift**: Various OpenShift related material, including instructions for setup and templates.

Installation
------------
This application is meant to be deployed to RedHat OpenShift version 4. Full instructions to deploy to OpenShift are in the `openshift` directory.

Developer Prerequisites
-----------------------

**Public Application**
- .Net Core SDK (5.0)
- Node.js 
- .NET Core IDE such as Visual Studio or VS Code
- JAG VPN with access to MS Dynamics

**DevOps**
- RedHat OpenShift tools
- Docker
- A familiarity with Jenkins



Microsoft Dynamics, SharePoint
---------------------------
A MS Dynamics instance containing the necessary solution files is required.  A SharePoint connection is optional.  If no SharePoint connection is available then file operations will not be executed.

Define the following secrets in your development environment (secrets or environment variables):
1. DYNAMICS_NATIVE_ODATA_URI: The URI to the Dynamics Web API endpoint.  Example:  `https://<hostname>/<tenant name>/api/data/v9.0/`.  This URI can be a proxy.
2. DYNAMICS_NATIVE_ODATA_URI: The native URI to the Dynamics Web API endpoint, in other words as the server identifies itself in responses to WebAPI requests.  Do not put a proxy URI here.
3. SSG_USERNAME: API gateway username, if using an API gateway
4. SSG_PASSWORD: API gateway password, if using an API gateway
5. DYNAMICS_AAD_TENANT_ID: ADFS Tenant ID, if using ADFS authentication.  Leave blank if using an API gateway
6. DYNAMICS_SERVER_APP_ID_URI: ADFS Server App ID URI. Leave blank if using an API gateway
7. DYNAMICS_CLIENT_ID: Public Key for the ADFS Enterprise Application app registration. Leave blank if using an API gateway
8. SHAREPOINT_ODATA_URI: Endpoint to be used for SharePoint, exclusive of _api.  Can be a proxy.  Leave blank if not using SharePoint.
9. SHAREPOINT_NATIVE_BASE_URI:  The SharePoint URI as configured in SharePoint.  Do not set to a proxy.
10. SHAREPOINT_SSG_USERNAME, SHAREPOINT_SSG_PASSWORD - optional API Gateway credentials for SharePoint
11. SharePoint may also use the same ADFS credentials as Dynamics.  If that is to be used, leave all SSG parameters empty or undefined.



DevOps Process
-------------

## Jenkins

If any pipeline steps do not start, a common root cause is problems with Jenkins.  Restart the Jenkins service by scaling it down to 0 pods, then back up to 1 pod.

## DEV builds
Dev builds are triggered by source code being committed to the repository.  This process triggers a webhook which initiates the DEV build pipeline.

Login to the OpenShift Web Console and navigate to the Tools project for the system, and view the status of the DEV portal pipeline build config to see the status of the build.

## TEST Builds
Merge code to the "master" branch from the "develop" branch to trigger a TEST build.

TEST builds are triggered by source code being committed to the master branch of the repository.  This process triggers a webhook which initiates the TEST build pipeline.

Login to the OpenShift Web Console and navigate to the Tools project for the system, and view the status of the TEST portal pipeline build config to see the status of the build. 

## Promotion to PROD
Login to the OpenShift Web Console and navigate to the Tools project for the system.  Go to the Build Config for the PROD Pipeline.  Click  Start Build. 

Navigate to the Logs for the build and click the link to go to the Jenkins logs.

View the Console Logs.

You will then have to CONFIRM the build by clicking on the related log item for the build that has been started.
